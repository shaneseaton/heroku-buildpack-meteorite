I found for metoer 0.7.0.1 it wouldn't work with the latest stable node package (0.10.25 at time of writting). So in order to test older versions I have fixed the compile script to use the version numbers specified in the package.json file of the application.

I am now using 0.10.22 with meteor(ite) 0.7.0.1 and deployment to heroku is working.

I am also using the free accounts with heroku and mongolab
